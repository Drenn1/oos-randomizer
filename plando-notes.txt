PROGRESSION SUMMARY:
    Start off with bombs, powder, gnarled key. Gain access to D2.

    In D2 we get biggoron's sword, which is used to get the bracelet from the
    map chest. At the end of the dungeon is the cane.

    In town, you can get shovel from the SW chest, and summer from the shop.

    (TODO: where is sword? Maybe temple of seasons?)

    This opens up north horon, specifically the path to D3. Floodgate key is
    vanilla and opens up D3, which is actually D1. The cane must be used to
    access D3, without having flippers or pegasus seeds.

    There's nothing particularly shocking in D1. Maybe throw in some jewels?
    But the boss turns out to be pumpkin head, and he has the satchel.
    Immediately, the player has access to ember seeds, pegasus seeds, and
    mystery seeds.

    Eastern Suburbs is now accessible. Woods of winter gives gale
    seeds, conveniently. Subrosia portal leads to subrosia, but player should
    enter D2 (D3) first.

    By now, they should have a hint that feather is on Mothula (and Gleeok has
    cape?). They will get the switch hook and use that to reach Mothula without
    feather.

    Subrosia portal is vanilla. In subrosia, they'll find a sword, and a flute
    in the market (needs feather). The flute allows them to get the pirate's
    bell on top of d2. Pirate portal is in spool swamp. This leads to D6.

    (TODO: L-1 boomerang should be prior to here, or in D6?)

    In D6, they'll get seed shooter. They should have a hint that magic
    boomerang is "near a trampoline in D6".  They'll use seed shooter to hit the
    orbs, instead of magic boomerang.  Although possible normally, this is
    extremely difficult, so some rooms may need to be modified slightly. They'll
    get magic boomerang and flippers here.

    (TODO: Got winter, dragon key, pirate's bell somewhere?)

    There's now a choice between D4 (in D4) and D7 (in D8; horon portal). D4 is
    doable, but does not contain any progression.

    In D4, use of seed shooter will be required, and slingshot will be on Gohma
    (though it's useless). They'll also get power glove to speed up the
    pot-pushing puzzle.

    In D7, cape is on Gleeok (should have a hint for this). Switch hook can be
    used to hit the button. Maybe change the room layout so that this is
    necessary?

    Will also get mermaid suit in D7. Should test whether it's possible to skip
    the poe with mermaid suit + swimmer's ring.

    (TODO: fall in D7?)

    D8 (in D5) is now unlocked. It's fine to have it unlocked earlier, since
    cape is required. HSS skip will be required, as HSS is on Medusa Head
    (should have a hint for this). Can use the cane to make HSS skip easier. Key
    layout may be problematic, though. Might throw in Tune of Echoes in one of
    the chests.

    (TODO: Spring and the jewels)

    With all seasons and jewels, D5 (in D6) is unlocked. The gloves are in the
    vanilla BK location; cane is needed to get to it. Might need to prevent
    player from activating the magnet ball, or move it to a non-blocking
    location.

    Finally, onox's castle is replaced with the black tower.

Dungeon ordering:
    D5: late-game (to complete, at least; magnet gloves late in dungeon)
    D6: mid-game (before boomerang / shooter, after cane, feather)
    D7: mid-game (after cane/hook; before cape)

    D2 (biggoron's sword, bracelet, cane)
        A bit too jam-packed with items.

    D1 (shovel, satchel), (boss is pumpkin head)
        Kinda boring dungeon, but the boss is a nice twist.

    D3 (switch hook, feather)
        Creative way to reach the boss.

    D6 (seed shooter, flippers, boomerang) (boss is plasmarine)
        Couldn't put boomerang in a thematically nice location, and rooms
        have to be modified for the shooter to work.

    D4 (power glove, slingshot)
        Power glove is a cute touch, but it's useless, as is the slingshot.

    D7 (mermaid suit, cape)
        Creative use of switch hook, but little else.

    D8 (harp of ages, HSS)
        Creative use of cane, but little else.

    D5 (magnet gloves)
        Use of cane is obvious, but cool nonetheless.
