# Out of logic

The following ways of navigating inner caves, etc are potential softlocks, if you have no way to get there naturally, or have gales seeds, or tree warp:

- jumping down from the graveyard in western coast
- diving down from sunken city to winter woods
- inside the windmill, jumping down from where the heart piece is
- jumping down the chimney of Holly's house
- jumping down from moblin keep
- jumping down from d2 alternate entrances, TODO: thought this was removed, so need to fix this
- jumping down from the 3 set of entrances in Northest mt cucco by the banana tree
- jumping down from d6, getting through the other side of lost woods
- jumping down from the tarm deku entrance
- jumping down from the samasa desert chest cliff
- in upper temple remains, jumping down the 1 cliff that connects in the Northwest

# Tricks/tips

- d2 & especially d6 rupee rooms may now hold more value in entrance rando
- the shield in the subrosia shop may be required more often in entrance rando, despite not being in the tracker/spoiler log. Mostly for d3 or d6 spiky beetles
