- make sure each exit value is correct  
- put gale seeds into logic in more places so that you can jump down usual soft lock cliffs  
- currently Moblin keep outer entrances are just not considered in logic, which is a nice fix for making sure you can still blow it up. I could probably do something better for it. Need to consider more options
- fix sprites in some subrosia houses, notably smithy and minigame  
- (if adding minigame into rando, need to fix exit warping to vanilla location)  
- making sure that season is reset everytime you exit onto the overworld
- check mt cucco cave going up - can you jump down snow block?
- check rando entrances not setting natzu properly
